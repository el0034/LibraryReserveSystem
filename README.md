The Library Reserve System (LRS) is going to be designed to solve organizational and record keeping issues with books, laptops, study rooms, etc. (items) 
that a library is able to loan out to students, faculty, or whomever else they wish to rent out items to. This system will also keep all of the current features of 
a reservation system in one central web application. 

Our client is the West Virginia University: Institute of Technology (WVU Tech) library. Currently, to check out a book at Reserves, the book for the course must be 
found through a printed Excel spreadsheet. Then, a physical call card is filled out, and the book is checked out to the student. Once the book is returned, the book is
checked back in and the call card is manually updated. The call cards that are located on the desk show which books are checked out and to whom. Each summer these call
cards are manually looked over for record keeping purposes, and the information on the cards are input into an Excel spreadsheet by hand for statistics. This 
check-in/ check-out process is done with any item that can be rented in Reserves. 

This application can be used by other organizations who have a simple reservation system similar to WVU Tech. However, due to the nature of the LRS, the other 
organizations who wish to use this system must also have a smaller scale book management that they are using similar to that of WVU Techâ€™s library. 

The LRS will resolve many issues, including record keeping, centralized data, and most importantly efficiency. Rather than having to manually search through an 
Excel spreadsheet to find textbooks, and physically inputting information for statistics each summer, this application will allow for the digitization of everything 
that the reserve system currently handles. 

This project is created by Christiana DiPisa, Elizabeth Lowe, and Noah Quesenberry.
